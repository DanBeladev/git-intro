by [Yair Gordon](mailto:bluepostit101@gmail.com)

## Before We Start
1. Create your own [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
2. Install a simple text editor, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or the great [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

## Install Git
* For Mac OS, click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* For Windows, click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (or use the community-maintained [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/git))

## Test it out
1. Open a terminal
  * For Mac OS, find and open *Terminal*.
  * For Windows, press `Win`, type `cmd`, and press `<Enter>`.
2. Type this command and press `<Enter>`:  ```git --version```
3. You should see information about the Git program which has been installed on your computer, including its version number.
